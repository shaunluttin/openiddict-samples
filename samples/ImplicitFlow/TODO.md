# TODO

* Add a psuedo refresh token flow, for when the user's access_token expires.
  * Use "prompt=none" authorization requests
  * Same thing as the original request with prompt=none
  * Do this in an iFrame, so it is transparent to the end-user.

# Other Ideas

* Upgrade TypeScript to enter the world of async/await.
